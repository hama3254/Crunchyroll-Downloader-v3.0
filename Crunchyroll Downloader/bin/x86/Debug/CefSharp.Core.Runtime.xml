The <see cref="M:CefSharp.IBrowserHost.StartDownload(System.String)" /> method class can be used
to implement this functionality in CefSharp. Contact Google via
https://www.widevine.com/contact.html for details on CDM download.


path is a directory that must contain the following files:
  1. manifest.json file from the CDM binary distribution (see below).
  2. widevinecdm file from the CDM binary distribution (e.g.
     widevinecdm.dll on Windows).
  3. widevidecdmadapter file from the CEF binary distribution (e.g.

If any of these files are missing or if the manifest file has incorrect
contents the registration will fail and callback will receive an ErrorCode
value of <see cref="F:CefSharp.CdmRegistrationErrorCode.IncorrectContents" />.

The manifest.json file must contain the following keys:
  A. "os": Supported OS (e.g. "mac", "win" or "linux").
  B. "arch": Supported architecture (e.g. "ia32" or "x64").

  G. "x-cdm-codecs": List of supported codecs (e.g. "vp8,vp9.0,avc1").

A through E are used to verify compatibility with the current Chromium
version. If the CDM is not compatible the registration will fail and
callback will receive an ErrorCode value of <see cref="F:CefSharp.CdmRegistrationErrorCode.Incompatible" />.

If registration is not supported at the time that Cef.RegisterWidevineCdm() is called then callback

            <summary>
Crash reporting is configured using an INI-style config file named
crash_reporter.cfg. This file must be placed next to
the main application executable. File contents are as follows:

 # Comments start with a hash character and must be on their own line.

 [Config]
 ProductName=&lt;Value of the "prod" crash key; defaults to "cef"&gt;
 ProductVersion=&lt;Value of the "ver" crash key; defaults to the CEF version&gt;
 AppName=&lt;Windows only; App-specific folder name component for storing crash
          information; default to "CEF"&gt;
 ExternalHandler=&lt;Windows only; Name of the external handler exe to use
                  instead of re-launching the main exe; default to empty&gt;
 ServerURL=&lt;crash server URL; default to empty&gt;
 RateLimitEnabled=&lt;True if uploads should be rate limited; default to true&gt;
 MaxUploadsPerDay=&lt;Max uploads per 24 hours, used if rate limit is enabled;
                   default to 5&gt;
 MaxDatabaseSizeInMb=&lt;Total crash report disk usage greater than this value
                      will cause older reports to be deleted; default to 20&gt;
 MaxDatabaseAgeInDays=&lt;Crash reports older than this value will be deleted;
                       default to 5&gt;

 [CrashKeys]
 my_key1=&lt;small|medium|large&gt;
 my_key2=&lt;small|medium|large&gt;

Config section:

If "ProductName" and/or "ProductVersion" are set then the specified values
will be included in the crash dump metadata. 

If "AppName" is set on Windows then crash report information (metrics,
database and dumps) will be stored locally on disk under the
"C:\Users\[CurrentUser]\AppData\Local\[AppName]\User Data" folder. 

If "ExternalHandler" is set on Windows then the specified exe will be
launched as the crashpad-handler instead of re-launching the main process
exe. The value can be an absolute path or a path relative to the main exe
directory. 

If "ServerURL" is set then crashes will be uploaded as a multi-part POST
request to the specified URL. Otherwise, reports will only be stored locally
on disk.

If "RateLimitEnabled" is set to true then crash report uploads will be rate
limited as follows:
 1. If "MaxUploadsPerDay" is set to a positive value then at most the
    specified number of crashes will be uploaded in each 24 hour period.
 2. If crash upload fails due to a network or server error then an
    incremental backoff delay up to a maximum of 24 hours will be applied for
    retries.
 3. If a backoff delay is applied and "MaxUploadsPerDay" is &gt; 1 then the
    "MaxUploadsPerDay" value will be reduced to 1 until the client is
    restarted. This helps to avoid an upload flood when the network or
    server error is resolved.

If "MaxDatabaseSizeInMb" is set to a positive value then crash report storage
on disk will be limited to that size in megabytes. For example, on Windows
each dump is about 600KB so a "MaxDatabaseSizeInMb" value of 20 equates to
about 34 crash reports stored on disk.

If "MaxDatabaseAgeInDays" is set to a positive value then crash reports older
than the specified age in days will be deleted.

CrashKeys section:

Any number of crash keys can be specified for use by the application. Crash
key values will be truncated based on the specified size (small = 63 bytes,
medium = 252 bytes, large = 1008 bytes). The value of crash keys can be set
from any thread or process using the Cef.SetCrashKeyValue function. These
key/value pairs will be sent to the crash server along with the crash dump
file. Medium and large values will be chunked for submission. For example,
if your key is named "mykey" then the value will be broken into ordered
chunks and submitted using keys named "mykey-1", "mykey-2", etc.

            <remarks>
The same-origin policy restricts how scripts hosted from different origins
(scheme + domain + port) can communicate. By default, scripts can only access
resources with the same origin. Scripts hosted on the HTTP and HTTPS schemes
(but no other schemes) can use the "Access-Control-Allow-Origin" header to
allow cross-origin requests. For example, https://source.example.com can make
XMLHttpRequest requests on http://target.example.com if the
http://target.example.com request returns an "Access-Control-Allow-Origin:
https://source.example.com" response header.
Scripts in separate frames or iframes and hosted from the same protocol and
domain suffix can execute cross-origin JavaScript if both pages set the
document.domain value to the same domain suffix. For example,
scheme://foo.example.com and scheme://bar.example.com can communicate using
JavaScript if both domains set document.domain="example.com".
This method is used to allow access to origins that would otherwise violate
the same-origin policy. Scripts hosted underneath the fully qualified
<paramref name="sourceOrigin" /> URL (like http://www.example.com) will be allowed access to
all resources hosted on the specified <paramref name="targetProtocol" /> and <paramref name="targetDomain" />.
If <paramref name="targetDomain" /> is non-empty and <paramref name="allowTargetSubdomains" /> if false only
exact domain matches will be allowed. If <paramref name="targetDomain" /> contains a top-
level domain component (like "example.com") and <paramref name="allowTargetSubdomains" /> is
true sub-domain matches will be allowed. If <paramref name="targetDomain" /> is empty and
<paramref name="allowTargetSubdomains" /> if true all domains and IP addresses will be
allowed.
This method cannot be used to bypass the restrictions on local or display
isolated schemes. See the comments on <see cref="T:CefSharp.CefCustomScheme" /> for more
information.

This function may be called on any thread. Returns false if <paramref name="sourceOrigin" />
is invalid or the whitelist cannot be accessed.

Load an extension. If extension resources will be read from disk using the default load implementation then rootDirectoy
should be the absolute path to the extension resources directory and manifestJson should be null.
If extension resources will be provided by the client (e.g. via IRequestHandler and/or IExtensionHandler) then rootDirectory
should be a path component unique to the extension (if not absolute this will be internally prefixed with the PK_DIR_RESOURCES path)
and manifestJson should contain the contents that would otherwise be read from the "manifest.json" file on disk.
The loaded extension will be accessible in all contexts sharing the same storage (HasExtension returns true).
However, only the context on which this method was called is considered the loader (DidLoadExtension returns true) and only the
loader will receive IRequestContextHandler callbacks for the extension. <see cref="M:CefSharp.IExtensionHandler.OnExtensionLoaded(CefSharp.IExtension)" /> will be
called on load success or <see cref="M:CefSharp.IExtensionHandler.OnExtensionLoadFailed(CefSharp.CefErrorCode)" /> will be called on load failure.
If the extension specifies a background script via the "background" manifest key then <see cref="M:CefSharp.IExtensionHandler.OnBeforeBackgroundBrowser(CefSharp.IExtension,System.String,CefSharp.IBrowserSettings)" />
will be called to create the background browser. See that method for additional information about background scripts.
For visible extension views the client application should evaluate the manifest to determine the correct extension URL to load and then pass
that URL to the IBrowserHost.CreateBrowser* function after the extension has loaded. For example, the client can look for the "browser_action"
manifest key as documented at https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/browserAction. Extension URLs take the form "chrome-extension:///".
Browsers that host extensions differ from normal browsers as follows: - Can access chrome.* JavaScript APIs if allowed by the manifest.
Visit chrome://extensions-support for the list of extension APIs currently supported by CEF. - Main frame navigation to non-extension
content is blocked.
- Pinch-zooming is disabled.
- <see cref="P:CefSharp.IBrowserHost.Extension" /> returns the hosted extension.
- CefBrowserHost::IsBackgroundHost returns true for background hosts. See https://developer.chrome.com/extensions for extension implementation and usage documentation.

A request context provides request handling for a set of related browser objects.
A request context is specified when creating a new browser object via the CefBrowserHost
static factory methods. Browser objects with different request contexts will never be
hosted in the same render process. Browser objects with the same request context may or
may not be hosted in the same render process depending on the process model.
Browser objects created indirectly via the JavaScript window.open function or targeted
links will share the same render process and the same request context as the source browser.
When running in single-process mode there is only a single render process (the main process)
and so all browsers created in single-process mode will share the same request context.
This will be the first request context passed into a CefBrowserHost static factory method
and all other request context objects will be ignored.
